# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# b. merges training and test data by first assigning data to meaningful names, r binding test and train aspects of the Data, names varibles and combines into one Data set
# c. exctracts mean and std for the different measurments then subsets data
# d. subs activity IDs for descptive names and subs short had for measurements to meaning ful names
